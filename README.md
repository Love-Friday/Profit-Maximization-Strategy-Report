The project will assess salesperson performance and recommend ways for underperforming sales staff to improve based on customer and regional needs.

## Business Problem 
Bokku Mart is facing challenges in optimizing sales across regions, product categories, and sales teams. There are discrepancies in revenue performance, with some regions and product categories underperforming. Sales staff performance varies, and there is a need to better understand customer behavior and seasonal trends. The company seeks actionable insights to improve sales, profitability, and customer retention.

By addressing these questions, the company can identify areas for improvement and develop strategies to optimize revenue and customer retention.
1. How does revenue performance differ across regions, and which regions are underperforming? What are the underlying factors causing this underperformance, and what strategies can be implemented to enhance sales in these regions?
2. Which product categories are driving the highest and lowest sales, and what opportunities exist to further capitalize on top-performing categories while addressing underperforming ones?
3. Which salesperson contributes the most to sales, and are there any patterns in their performance? How can underperforming salespeople adjust their approach to better serve customer segments and regions to boost overall sales?
4. Can we identify high-value customers who generate the most revenue, and what strategies can be developed to retain and expand these relationships for sustained business growth?

### Data Cleaning
In this report, I will outline the data cleaning process undertaken to prepare the dataset for analysis. The dataset, which contains sales information from various regions, required several steps to ensure accuracy and consistency. Below are the key actions taken to clean and organize the data effectively. 

- Loaded the dataset into ms excel
- Removed duplicates (none found): select data > click data tab > click  remove duplicates icon.
- used the PROPER function in the Salesperson column to convert text to proper case, correcting mixed capitalization, =PROPER(C2:C911)
- Applied VALUE(CLEAN) function in the item price column to eliminate non-printable characters and convert text values to numbers, =VALUE(CLEAN(H2:H911)
- The revenue column automatically updates by formatting it to calculate item price multiplied by the number of items  = H2 * I2 
- Inserted two additional columns to extract Year and Month name values from the Date column
- utilized the YEAR function to extract the year from the Date column; =YEAR(K2 : K911)
- Employed the TEXT function to extract the month name from the Date column;  =Text(G2,"MMM")

### Results & Visualization
The sales analysis for Bokku Mart reveals significant regional performance disparities, with regions like Lagos and Abuja outperforming areas such as Kaduna and Enugu, suggesting a need for targeted sales strategies in underperforming regions. Electronics and Groceries drive the highest revenue, while categories like Clothing and Home Decor show lower sales, highlighting opportunities for focused marketing and inventory management. Salesperson performance varies widely, with a few top performers contributing most of the revenue, indicating that additional support and training could benefit underperforming staff. Seasonal trends indicate peak sales during the holiday season, with a noticeable drop afterward, suggesting opportunities for post-holiday promotions to sustain revenue. High-value customers generate the majority of revenue, emphasizing the importance of retaining these customers through tailored loyalty programs. Visualizations such as bar charts, pie charts, and line graphs effectively illustrate these trends and insights.

### Insights and Findings 
The following insights are derived from an in-depth analysis of the sales data, supported by visualizations that highlight key trends and patterns.

- Sales Growth Trends Over Time:
The revenue trend over the months reveals a general upward slope at the beginning of the period, with a notable peak in the first few months, followed by a steady decline through the middle of the year. From April to August, the sales figures remained relatively stable, showing little fluctuation. However, towards the end of the year, there is a sharp increase in revenue, culminating in a significant rise in the final month. This pattern suggests a seasonal fluctuation, where sales are strongest at the beginning and end of the year, while the months in between show a consistent but lower level of performance.  This indicates that seasonal factors, such as changes in market demand or the timing of promotional activities, are likely contributing to these fluctuations. This fluctuation indicates potential seasonality or external factors influencing revenue generation, with a recovery in December, which ends the year on a high note.

- Product Sales Distribution:
The pie chart of product sales distribution demonstrates that Drinking water contributes to 22.7% of total revenue, whereas Milk Tea 18.61% and Water Dispenser	17.54% account for much smaller shares. Given Drinking water dominance, there may be opportunities to expand its marketing efforts and optimize its pricing strategy to capitalize on its popularity.

- Customer Segmentation and Buying Behavior:
The bar chart depicting customer segments by purchase frequency highlights that KFC is a high-value customer based on her purchase trunover and contributed to 31% of total sales. This indicated a strong opportunity to focus on customer retention programs, loyalty rewards, and targeted marketing for these segments to increase lifetime value.

- Salesperson Sales Performance:
The bar chart visualizing salesperson performance reveals that Vaughn, Harlon contributes the highest revenue throughout for the two years, with notable peaks in Q1 and Q3. This suggests that Vaughn Harlon has a strong ability to capture high-value sales during key periods, possibly leveraging targeted strategies or client relationships during peak demand times.
In contrast, other salespeople show more inconsistent performance, with some achieving higher revenue in certain months, while others maintain steady but lower sales levels across the year. This indicates a potential opportunity for the lower-performing salespeople to refine their approach, especially during peak months.
